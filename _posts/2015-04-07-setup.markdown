<p>I decided to learn functional programming, and here come my very first steps.</p>

<p>First, I made decision about what functional programming language to learn. After doing some research about few of them, Lisp, Python and Haskell, I chose the last one. For no special reason, really, it looked cool and enough resources are available.</p>

<p>Then, I also decided to blog about my learning process, for my record, and just in case it could help anyone else out there. I had to think about a blogging platform or tools. I decided to go for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a>. This combination of tools, despite requiring more effort compared to a fully hosted solution, I think would be more flexible and maybe I could learn something by the way.</p>

<p>While both Github pages and Jekyll do have good documentation and is very easy to start with them, even if frontend is not really my thing. Still I found a couple of issues.</p>

<p>I am using Ubuntu, and while trying to install Jekyll I got some error messages and it failed to install. I could solved quite easy following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13767725/unable-to-install-gem-failed-to-build-gem-native-extension-cannot-load-such">this explanation</a>, installing ruby-dev.</p>

<p>Once I had Jekyll installed locally, still I had issues trying to run the server. It was complaining no Javascript runtime was found. I checked <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2327">this thread</a> about same issue, and for me installing therubytracer worked just fine.</p>

<p>After having Jekyll up and running, I chose a <a href="https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">blog template</a> and added some nice <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">code formatting</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, the good stuff can start, my first contact with Haskell. I am using a couple of books, <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real world Haskell</a> and <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn you a Haskell for great good</a>.</p>

<p>I have just gone through the first chapter of each book, and I am already glad I have chosen Haskell. The code is compact and expressful; specially compared to Java.</p>

<p>I will be posting my code to GitHub, either as project or for simple things as a Gist. For those looking for the exercise solution at the end of the first chapter of Real world Haskell, you can check it out <a href="https://gist.github.com/eva-villarroya/7d3ea3b6ac628a2b876c">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am using gist from the command line, and since it required some trial and error, here comes a compilation of useful commands.</p>

<pre><code class="bash CamingoCode-Bold">

<p>Note how after commiting for first time, an identifier is returned as part of the gist URL. From there on, that file can be updated by referencing that same id. If no id is supplied, a different gist is created.</p>
